Reddit;AITA for kicking out my sister in law for spreading (true) rumors about my marriage.;EnvironmentalGur2853;;2024/01/10;https://www.reddit.com//r/AITAH/comments/192z4xg/aita_for_kicking_out_my_sister_in_law_for/;"My (M32) sister-in-law (F18) is living with my wife (F27) and I while she attends university. She has a partial scholarship and we let her live here so her family can save money.My wife was injured severely in a fall while hiking two years ago. Unfortunately she has lost the use of her limbs.I love my wife very much and I will never divorce her. We have two very young kids that need us both. Also my work provides us with medical insurance which obviously is very important to us.The crux of the matter comes down to sex. My wife cannot have sex. Not any kind. There are medical reasons. No I won't go into it. About one year after her accident my wife was feeling very down. She was in a very dark place. She thought I was going to leave her and go be with someone else. I did not have anyone else on the side. I also had no time. I was working, taking care of two kids, and assisting in her care. I literally had no time for anything like that. Anyway it lead to a fight that lead to me admitting that I still had physical needs that weren't being met by a quick wank in the shower.Before you ask yes we are both in therapy. This has been a situation that neither of of imagined when we met.Long story short, my wife finds me women that I sleep with and have zero emotional attachment to. I do not go looking for women and I don't tell my wife what to do. When she decides that I need it she makes the arrangements. It's not perfect. It's not what I want. I want my wife to be healthy again. I want to hold her. I want to be with her. It's never going to happen.It was a private decision that we made together. And as far as I'm concerned it should have stayed private.My sister-in-law moved in with us in September to start university. She helps out around the house and with the kids. In return she lives in our basement suite and I give her some spending money. She doesn't work hours a day or anything. She might watch the kids while I make dinner or she will work in my wife's garden.One of the nights that I was going out as arranged my sister-in-law was supposed to watch the kids. Instead she got one of her friends to watch them and she followed me.She saw me go meet a woman and go up to a hotel room. She took pictures.Rather than talk to her sister about it she decided to wait until Christmas when we had the family over to ""confront"" me with the evidence in front of everyone.I was pissed. My wife was furious and embarrassed. My in-laws were getting ready to kick my ass until my wife spoke up and explained everything. Nobody is really okay with it but it wasn't what they thought. But now everyone knows something very private about us that we didn't want publicized.I talked to my wife about it and her sister is no longer welcome to live with us. She is having to commute from her parents home almost two hours each way.Tough shit. She could have talked to us. She could have confronted me. She could have talked to her sister. Instead she chose to be a hero and tell everyone something that was never meant to be public.She is begging us to come back because she now has no social life because she is traveling 3.5 to 4 hours a day. Her parents are offering to rent the basement but we do not want her here.AITAH?";1203

I decided to make mac and cheese so I got the ingredients for it. Apparently there was some sort of tear in the macaroni packet I've got and there were ants inside my mac. I didn't notice. I already dumped that mac in. Saw lots of ants float up so i removed the ones i could see. There were still more but I've resigned to my fate. Sunk cost fallacy is real and my mac and cheese changed the person I am now. I put a lot of pepper on top to cope. I sent this picture to my boyfriend and he said it looked delicious and that he wished he could have some. No, Jaden, you don't. I can't subject you to eating ants like I did. The mac and cheese was grainy. The ants probably added more texture.;559

Reddit;My male roommate who I barely speak to asked me for sex;Nothing_of_the_Sort;;2024/01/10;https://www.reddit.com//r/badroommates/comments/192tdq1/my_male_roommate_who_i_barely_speak_to_asked_me/;LITERALLY OUT OF NOWHERE. What the fuck, I feel so disgusting and like I can’t even be comfortable in my own house. He’s done weird stuff before like touch my tattoo without asking and asking me to scratch his shoulders at like 3 am, but I just blamed that on him drinking every day. He stays in his room and LOUDLY fucks his incredibly annoying girlfriend Diane all day and night. Then I asked if he’s cool with me watching my friend’s dog and this was his reply. Yuck.;1356
