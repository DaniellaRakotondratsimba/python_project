Reddit;AITA for kicking out my sister in law for spreading (true) rumors about my marriage.;EnvironmentalGur2853;;2024/01/10;https://www.reddit.com//r/AITAH/comments/192z4xg/aita_for_kicking_out_my_sister_in_law_for/;"My (M32) sister-in-law (F18) is living with my wife (F27) and I while she attends university. She has a partial scholarship and we let her live here so her family can save money.My wife was injured severely in a fall while hiking two years ago. Unfortunately she has lost the use of her limbs.I love my wife very much and I will never divorce her. We have two very young kids that need us both. Also my work provides us with medical insurance which obviously is very important to us.The crux of the matter comes down to sex. My wife cannot have sex. Not any kind. There are medical reasons. No I won't go into it. About one year after her accident my wife was feeling very down. She was in a very dark place. She thought I was going to leave her and go be with someone else. I did not have anyone else on the side. I also had no time. I was working, taking care of two kids, and assisting in her care. I literally had no time for anything like that. Anyway it lead to a fight that lead to me admitting that I still had physical needs that weren't being met by a quick wank in the shower.Before you ask yes we are both in therapy. This has been a situation that neither of of imagined when we met.Long story short, my wife finds me women that I sleep with and have zero emotional attachment to. I do not go looking for women and I don't tell my wife what to do. When she decides that I need it she makes the arrangements. It's not perfect. It's not what I want. I want my wife to be healthy again. I want to hold her. I want to be with her. It's never going to happen.It was a private decision that we made together. And as far as I'm concerned it should have stayed private.My sister-in-law moved in with us in September to start university. She helps out around the house and with the kids. In return she lives in our basement suite and I give her some spending money. She doesn't work hours a day or anything. She might watch the kids while I make dinner or she will work in my wife's garden.One of the nights that I was going out as arranged my sister-in-law was supposed to watch the kids. Instead she got one of her friends to watch them and she followed me.She saw me go meet a woman and go up to a hotel room. She took pictures.Rather than talk to her sister about it she decided to wait until Christmas when we had the family over to ""confront"" me with the evidence in front of everyone.I was pissed. My wife was furious and embarrassed. My in-laws were getting ready to kick my ass until my wife spoke up and explained everything. Nobody is really okay with it but it wasn't what they thought. But now everyone knows something very private about us that we didn't want publicized.I talked to my wife about it and her sister is no longer welcome to live with us. She is having to commute from her parents home almost two hours each way.Tough shit. She could have talked to us. She could have confronted me. She could have talked to her sister. Instead she chose to be a hero and tell everyone something that was never meant to be public.She is begging us to come back because she now has no social life because she is traveling 3.5 to 4 hours a day. Her parents are offering to rent the basement but we do not want her here.AITAH?";1203

I decided to make mac and cheese so I got the ingredients for it. Apparently there was some sort of tear in the macaroni packet I've got and there were ants inside my mac. I didn't notice. I already dumped that mac in. Saw lots of ants float up so i removed the ones i could see. There were still more but I've resigned to my fate. Sunk cost fallacy is real and my mac and cheese changed the person I am now. I put a lot of pepper on top to cope. I sent this picture to my boyfriend and he said it looked delicious and that he wished he could have some. No, Jaden, you don't. I can't subject you to eating ants like I did. The mac and cheese was grainy. The ants probably added more texture.;559

What the fuck, I feel so disgusting and like I can’t even be comfortable in my own house. He’s done weird stuff before like touch my tattoo without asking and asking me to scratch his shoulders at like 3 am, but I just blamed that on him drinking every day. He stays in his room and LOUDLY fucks his incredibly annoying girlfriend Diane all day and night. Then I asked if he’s cool with me watching my friend’s dog and this was his reply. Yuck.;1356

Reddit;AITA for kicking out my sister in law for spreading (true) rumors about my marriage.;EnvironmentalGur2853;;2024/01/10;https://www.reddit.com//r/AITAH/comments/192z4xg/aita_for_kicking_out_my_sister_in_law_for/;"My (M32) sister-in-law (F18) is living with my wife (F27) and I while she attends university. She has a partial scholarship and we let her live here so her family can save money.My wife was injured severely in a fall while hiking two years ago. Unfortunately she has lost the use of her limbs.I love my wife very much and I will never divorce her. We have two very young kids that need us both. Also my work provides us with medical insurance which obviously is very important to us.The crux of the matter comes down to sex. My wife cannot have sex. Not any kind. There are medical reasons. No I won't go into it. About one year after her accident my wife was feeling very down. She was in a very dark place. She thought I was going to leave her and go be with someone else. I did not have anyone else on the side. I also had no time. I was working, taking care of two kids, and assisting in her care. I literally had no time for anything like that. Anyway it lead to a fight that lead to me admitting that I still had physical needs that weren't being met by a quick wank in the shower.Before you ask yes we are both in therapy. This has been a situation that neither of of imagined when we met.Long story short, my wife finds me women that I sleep with and have zero emotional attachment to. I do not go looking for women and I don't tell my wife what to do. When she decides that I need it she makes the arrangements. It's not perfect. It's not what I want. I want my wife to be healthy again. I want to hold her. I want to be with her. It's never going to happen.It was a private decision that we made together. And as far as I'm concerned it should have stayed private.My sister-in-law moved in with us in September to start university. She helps out around the house and with the kids. In return she lives in our basement suite and I give her some spending money. She doesn't work hours a day or anything. She might watch the kids while I make dinner or she will work in my wife's garden.One of the nights that I was going out as arranged my sister-in-law was supposed to watch the kids. Instead she got one of her friends to watch them and she followed me.She saw me go meet a woman and go up to a hotel room. She took pictures.Rather than talk to her sister about it she decided to wait until Christmas when we had the family over to ""confront"" me with the evidence in front of everyone.I was pissed. My wife was furious and embarrassed. My in-laws were getting ready to kick my ass until my wife spoke up and explained everything. Nobody is really okay with it but it wasn't what they thought. But now everyone knows something very private about us that we didn't want publicized.I talked to my wife about it and her sister is no longer welcome to live with us. She is having to commute from her parents home almost two hours each way.Tough shit. She could have talked to us. She could have confronted me. She could have talked to her sister. Instead she chose to be a hero and tell everyone something that was never meant to be public.She is begging us to come back because she now has no social life because she is traveling 3.5 to 4 hours a day. Her parents are offering to rent the basement but we do not want her here.AITAH?";1192

I decided to make mac and cheese so I got the ingredients for it. Apparently there was some sort of tear in the macaroni packet I've got and there were ants inside my mac. I didn't notice.

Arxiv;Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and Relative Entropy;Shui Feng;;2022/10/24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13142v1;The Hierarchical Dirichlet process is a discrete random measure serving as animportant prior in Bayesian non-parametrics. It is motivated with the study ofgroups of clustered data. Each group is modelled through a level two Dirichletprocess and all groups share the same base distribution which itself is a drawnfrom a level one Dirichlet process. It has two concentration parameters withone at each level. The main results of the paper are the law of large numbersand large deviations for the hierarchical Dirichlet process and its mass whenboth concentration parameters converge to infinity. The large deviation ratefunctions are identified explicitly. The rate function for the hierarchicalDirichlet process consists of two terms corresponding to the relative entropiesat each level. It is less than the rate function for the Dirichlet process,which reflects the fact that the number of clusters under the hierarchicalDirichlet process has a slower growth rate than under the Dirichlet process.;

We first prove this result for finite regular trees, and show that theDirichlet spectral gap in the infinite tree limit converges to the spectral gapof the infinite tree. We also perform Dirichlet spectral clustering on theIP-layer networks and show that it often yields cuts near the network core thatcreate genuine single-component clusters. This is much better than traditionalspectral clustering where several disjoint fragments near the periphery areliable to be misleadingly classified as a single cluster. Spectral clusteringis often used to identify bottlenecks or congestion; since congestion in thesenetworks is known to peak at the core, our results suggest that Dirichletspectral clustering may be better at finding bona-fide bottlenecks.";

Crucially, we consider the situation where a prior is placed on theconcentration parameter of the underlying Dirichlet process. Previous findingsin the literature suggest that Dirichlet process mixtures are typically notconsistent for the number of clusters if the concentration parameter is heldfixed and data come from a finite mixture. Here we show that consistency forthe number of clusters can be achieved if the concentration parameter isadapted in a fully Bayesian way, as commonly done in practice. Our results arederived for data coming from a class of finite mixtures, with mild assumptionson the prior for the concentration parameter and for a variety of choices oflikelihood kernels for the mixture.;

The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types, seizure-types,and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this model and its implementationin detail.

Arxiv;Dirichlet-tree multinomial mixtures for clustering microbiome  compositions;Jialiang Mao;Li Ma;2020/08/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00400v2;Studying the human microbiome has gained substantial interest in recentyears, and a common task in the analysis of these data is to cluster microbiomecompositions into subtypes. This subdivision of samples into subgroups servesas an intermediary step in achieving personalized diagnosis and treatment. Inapplying existing clustering methods to modern microbiome studies including theAmerican Gut Project (AGP) data, we found that this seemingly standard task,however, is very challenging in the microbiome composition context due toseveral key features of such data. Standard distance-based clusteringalgorithms generally do not produce reliable results as they do not take intoaccount the heterogeneity of the cross-sample variability among the bacterialtaxa, while existing model-based approaches do not allow sufficient flexibilityfor the identification of complex within-cluster variation from cross-clustervariation. Direct applications of such methods generally lead to overlydispersed clusters in the AGP data and such phenomenon is common for othermicrobiome data. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dirichlet-treemultinomial mixtures (DTMM) as a Bayesian generative model for clusteringamplicon sequencing data in microbiome studies. DTMM models the microbiomepopulation with a mixture of Dirichlet-tree kernels that utilizes thephylogenetic tree to offer a more flexible covariance structure incharacterizing within-cluster variation, and it provides a means foridentifying a subset of signature taxa that distinguish the clusters. Weperform extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of DTMM andcompare it to state-of-the-art model-based and distance-based clusteringmethods in the microbiome context. Finally, we report a case study on the fecaldata from the AGP to identify compositional clusters among individuals withinflammatory bowel disease and diabetes.;

A principal new finding onwhich these results are based is that such clusters admit invariant randomsubgraphs with positive isoperimetric constant.  We also show that percolation clusters in any amenable Cayley graph almostsurely admit no nonconstant harmonic Dirichlet functions. Conversely, on aCayley graph admitting nonconstant harmonic Dirichlet functions, almost surelythe infinite clusters of $p$-Bernoulli percolation also have nonconstantharmonic Dirichlet functions when $p$ is sufficiently close to 1.

Arxiv;Informed Bayesian Finite Mixture Models via Asymmetric Dirichlet Priors;Garritt L. Page;Massimo Ventrucci,Maria Franco-Villoria;2023/08/01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00768v1;Finite mixture models are flexible methods that are commonly used formodel-based clustering. A recent focus in the model-based clustering literatureis to highlight the difference between the number of components in a mixturemodel and the number of clusters. The number of clusters is more relevant froma practical stand point, but to date, the focus of prior distributionformulation has been on the number of components. In light of this, we developa finite mixture methodology that permits eliciting prior information directlyon the number of clusters in an intuitive way. This is done by employing anasymmetric Dirichlet distribution as a prior on the weights of a finitemixture. Further, a penalized complexity motivated prior is employed for theDirichlet shape parameter. We illustrate the ease to which prior informationcan be elicited via our construction and the flexibility of the resultinginduced prior on the number of clusters. We also demonstrate the utility of ourapproach using numerical experiments and two real world data sets.;

Arxiv;Revisiting k-means: New Algorithms via Bayesian Nonparametrics;Brian Kulis;Michael I.

For the most part, such flexibility is lacking inclassical clustering methods such as k-means. In this paper, we revisit thek-means clustering algorithm from a Bayesian nonparametric viewpoint. Inspiredby the asymptotic connection between k-means and mixtures of Gaussians, we showthat a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet process mixture approaches ahard clustering algorithm in the limit, and further that the resultingalgorithm monotonically minimizes an elegant underlying k-means-like clusteringobjective that includes a penalty for the number of clusters. We generalizethis analysis to the case of clustering multiple data sets through a similarasymptotic argument with the hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discussfurther extensions that highlight the benefits of our analysis: i) a spectralrelaxation involving thresholded eigenvectors, and ii) a normalized cut graphclustering algorithm that does not fix the number of clusters in the graph.;
Arxiv;Bayesian Clustering of Transcription Factor Binding Motifs;Shane T. Jensen;Jun S. Liu;2006/10/22;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610655v1;Genes are often regulated in living cells by proteins called transcriptionfactors (TFs) that bind directly to short segments of DNA in close proximity tospecific genes. These binding sites have a conserved nucleotide appearance,which is called a motif. Several recent studies of transcriptional regulationrequire the reduction of a large collection of motifs into clusters based onthe similarity of their nucleotide composition. We present a principledapproach to this clustering problem based upon a Bayesian hierarchical modelthat accounts for both within- and between-motif variability. We use aDirichlet process prior distribution that allows the number of clusters to varyand we also present a novel generalization that allows the core width of eachmotif to vary. This clustering model is implemented, using a Gibbs samplingstrategy, on several collections of transcription factor motif matrices. Ourclusters provide a means by which to organize transcription factors based onbinding motif similarities, which can be used to reduce motif redundancy withinlarge databases such as JASPAR and TRANSFAC. Finally, our clustering procedurehas been used in combination with discovery of evolutionarily-conserved motifsto predict co-regulated genes. An alternative to our Dirichlet process priordistribution is explored but shows no substantive difference in the clusteringresults for our datasets. Our Bayesian clustering model based on the Dirichletprocess has several advantages over traditional clustering methods that couldmake our procedure appropriate and useful for many clustering applications.;

Among existing technologies, the recently developed droplet-basedplatform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cellswith direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier(UMI). Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computationaltools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data.Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single celltranscriptomic data are still under-explored. Methods: We developed DIMM-SC, aDirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomicdata. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experimentsand characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichletmixture prior. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used for parameterinference. Results: We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SCand compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree andSeurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known clusterlabels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis withprior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulationstudies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achievessubstantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clusteringvariability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, asa model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertaintyfor each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference andbiological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existingclustering methods.;

Arxiv;Flexible clustering via hidden hierarchical Dirichlet priors;Antonio Lijoi;Igor Prünster,Giovanni Rebaudo;2022/01/18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06994v1;The Bayesian approach to inference stands out for naturally allowingborrowing information across heterogeneous populations, with different samplespossibly sharing the same distribution. A popular Bayesian nonparametric modelfor clustering probability distributions is the nested Dirichlet process, whichhowever has the drawback of grouping distributions in a single cluster whenties are observed across samples. With the goal of achieving a flexible andeffective clustering method for both samples and observations, we investigate anonparametric prior that arises as the composition of two different discreterandom structures and derive a closed-form expression for the induceddistribution of the random partition, the fundamental tool regulating theclustering behavior of the model. On the one hand, this allows to gain a deeperinsight into the theoretical properties of the model and, on the other hand, ityields an MCMC algorithm for evaluating Bayesian inferences of interest.Moreover, we single out limitations of this algorithm when working with morethan two populations and, consequently, devise an alternative more efficientsampling scheme, which as a by-product, allows testing homogeneity betweendifferent populations. Finally, we perform a comparison with the nestedDirichlet process and provide illustrative examples of both synthetic and realdata.;

Miller and Harrison (2014) provedposterior inconsistency in the number of clusters when the true number ofclusters is finite for Dirichlet process and Pitman--Yor process mixturemodels. In this work, we extend this result to additional Bayesiannonparametric priors such as Gibbs-type processes and finite-dimensionalrepresentations of them. The latter include the Dirichlet multinomial processand the recently proposed Pitman--Yor and normalized generalized gammamultinomial processes. We show that mixture models based on these processes arealso inconsistent in the number of clusters and discuss possible solutions.Notably, we show that a post-processing algorithm introduced by Guha et al.(2021) for the Dirichlet process extends to more general models and provides aconsistent method to estimate the number of components.;
Arxiv;A Bayesian View of the Poisson-Dirichlet Process;Wray Buntine;Marcus Hutter;2010/07/02;http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0296v2;The two parameter Poisson-Dirichlet Process (PDP), a generalisation of theDirichlet Process, is increasingly being used for probabilistic modelling indiscrete areas such as language technology, bioinformatics, and image analysis.There is a rich literature about the PDP and its derivative distributions suchas the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). This article reviews some of the basictheory and then the major results needed for Bayesian modelling of discreteproblems including details of priors, posteriors and computation.  The PDP allows one to build distributions over countable partitions. The PDPhas two other remarkable properties: first it is partially conjugate to itself,which allows one to build hierarchies of PDPs, and second using a marginalisedrelative the CRP, one gets fragmentation and clustering properties that letsone layer partitions to build trees. This article presents the basic theory forunderstanding the notion of partitions and distributions over them, the PDP andthe CRP, and the important properties of conjugacy, fragmentation andclustering, as well as some key related properties such as consistency andconvergence. This article also presents a Bayesian interpretation of thePoisson-Dirichlet process based on an improper and infinite dimensionalDirichlet distribution. This means we can understand the process as justanother Dirichlet and thus all its sampling properties emerge naturally.  The theory of PDPs is usually presented for continuous distributions (moregenerally referred to as non-atomic distributions), however, when applied todiscrete distributions its remarkable conjugacy property emerges. This contextand basic results are also presented, as well as techniques for computing thesecond order Stirling numbers that occur in the posteriors for discretedistributions.;

Within this framework, Dirichlet processmixture models emerge as a compelling alternative to conventional finitemixture models for both clustering and outlier detection tasks. However,despite their evident advantages, the widespread adoption of Dirichlet processmixture models in unsupervised outlier detection has been hampered bychallenges related to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to outliersduring the construction of detectors. To tackle these challenges, we propose anovel outlier detection method based on ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussianmixtures. The proposed method is a fully unsupervised algorithm thatcapitalizes on random subspace and subsampling ensembles, not only ensuringefficient computation but also enhancing the robustness of the resultingoutlier detector. Moreover, the proposed method leverages variational inferencefor Dirichlet process mixtures to ensure efficient and fast computation.Empirical studies with benchmark datasets demonstrate that our methodoutperforms existing approaches for unsupervised outlier detection.;

A useful concept introduced for Gaussian mixtures by Malsiner Walliet al (2016) are sparse finite mixtures, where the prior distribution on theweight distribution of a mixture with $K$ components is chosen in such a waythat a priori the number of clusters in the data is random and is allowed to besmaller than $K$ with high probability. The number of cluster is then inferreda posteriori from the data.  The present paper makes the following contributions in the context of sparsefinite mixture modelling. First, it is illustrated that the concept of sparsefinite mixture is very generic and easily extended to cluster various types ofnon-Gaussian data, in particular discrete data and continuous multivariate dataarising from non-Gaussian clusters. Second, sparse finite mixtures are comparedto Dirichlet process mixtures with respect to their ability to identify thenumber of clusters. For both model classes, a random hyper prior is consideredfor the parameters determining the weight distribution. By suitable matching ofthese priors, it is shown that the choice of this hyper prior is far moreinfluential on the cluster solution than whether a sparse finite mixture or aDirichlet process mixture is taken into consideration.;

However, existing methods cannot easily cluster the passengers dueto the hierarchical structure of the passenger trip information, namely: eachpassenger has multiple trips, and each trip contains multi-dimensionalmulti-mode information. Furthermore, existing approaches rely on an accuratespecification of the clustering number to start, which is difficult whenmillions of commuters are using the transport systems on a daily basis. In thispaper, we propose a novel Tensor Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model(Tensor-DPMM), which is designed to preserve the multi-mode and hierarchicalstructure of the multi-dimensional trip information via tensor, and clusterthem in a unified one-step manner. The model also has the ability to determinethe number of clusters automatically by using the Dirichlet Process to decidethe probabilities for a passenger to be either assigned in an existing clusteror to create a new cluster: This allows our model to grow the clusters asneeded in a dynamic manner. Finally, existing methods do not consider spatialsemantic graphs such as geographical proximity and functional similaritybetween the locations, which may cause inaccurate clustering. To this end, wefurther propose a variant of our model, namely the Tensor-DPMM with Graph. Forthe algorithm, we propose a tensor Collapsed Gibbs Sampling method, with aninnovative step of ""disband and relocating"", which disbands clusters with toosmall amount of members and relocates them to the remaining clustering. Thisavoids uncontrollable growing amounts of clusters. A case study based on HongKong metro passenger data is conducted to demonstrate the automatic process oflearning the number of clusters, and the learned clusters are better inwithin-cluster compactness and cross-cluster separateness.";

Arxiv;Colouring and breaking sticks: random distributions and heterogeneous  clustering;Peter J. Green;;2010/03/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3988v1;We begin by reviewing some probabilistic results about the Dirichlet Processand its close relatives, focussing on their implications for statisticalmodelling and analysis. We then introduce a class of simple mixture models inwhich clusters are of different `colours', with statistical characteristicsthat are constant within colours, but different between colours. Thus clusteridentities are exchangeable only within colours. The basic form of our model isa variant on the familiar Dirichlet process, and we find that much of thestandard modelling and computational machinery associated with the Dirichletprocess may be readily adapted to our generalisation. The methodology isillustrated with an application to the partially-parametric clustering of geneexpression profiles.;

We follow a Dirichlet process mixture approach and introduce a newclass of multivariate dependent Dirichlet processes (DDP). The proposed DDP arerepresented in terms of vector of stick-breaking processes with dependentweights. The weights are beta random vectors that determine different anddependent clustering effects along the dimension of the DDP vector.

Arxiv;Conjoined Dirichlet Process;Michelle N. Ngo;Dustin S. Pluta,Alexander N. Ngo,Babak Shahbaba;2020/02/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03223v1;Biclustering is a class of techniques that simultaneously clusters the rowsand columns of a matrix to sort heterogeneous data into homogeneous blocks.Although many algorithms have been proposed to find biclusters, existingmethods suffer from the pre-specification of the number of biclusters or placeconstraints on the model structure. To address these issues, we develop anovel, non-parametric probabilistic biclustering method based on Dirichletprocesses to identify biclusters with strong co-occurrence in both rows andcolumns. The proposed method utilizes dual Dirichlet process mixture models tolearn row and column clusters, with the number of resulting clusters determinedby the data rather than pre-specified. Probabilistic biclusters are identifiedby modeling the mutual dependence between the row and column clusters. We applyour method to two different applications, text mining and gene expressionanalysis, and demonstrate that our method improves bicluster extraction in manysettings compared to existing approaches.;

Theability to couple them however with nonparamet-ric priors such as the DirichletProcess (DP) hasn't seen similar success due to its non parameteriz-ablenature. In this paper, we present an alternative treatment of the variationalposterior of the Dirichlet Process Deep Latent Gaussian Mixture Model(DP-DLGMM), where we show that the prior cluster parameters and the variationalposteriors of the beta distributions and cluster hidden variables can beupdated in closed-form. This leads to a standard reparameterization trick onthe Gaussian latent variables knowing the cluster assignments. We demonstrateour approach on standard benchmark datasets, we show that our model is capableof generating realistic samples for each cluster obtained, and manifestscompetitive performance in a semi-supervised setting.;
Arxiv;Powered Hawkes-Dirichlet Process: Challenging Textual Clustering using a  Flexible Temporal Prior;Gaël Poux-Médard;Julien Velcin,Sabine Loudcher;2021/09/15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07170v1;The textual content of a document and its publication date are intertwined.For example, the publication of a news article on a topic is influenced byprevious publications on similar issues, according to underlying temporaldynamics. However, it can be challenging to retrieve meaningful informationwhen textual information conveys little information or when temporal dynamicsare hard to unveil. Furthermore, the textual content of a document is notalways linked to its temporal dynamics. We develop a flexible method to createclusters of textual documents according to both their content and publicationtime, the Powered Dirichlet-Hawkes process (PDHP). We show PDHP yieldssignificantly better results than state-of-the-art models when temporalinformation or textual content is weakly informative. The PDHP also alleviatesthe hypothesis that textual content and temporal dynamics are always perfectlycorrelated. PDHP allows retrieving textual clusters, temporal clusters, or amixture of both with high accuracy when they are not. We demonstrate that PDHPgeneralizes previous work --such as the Dirichlet-Hawkes process (DHP) andUniform process (UP). Finally, we illustrate the changes induced by PDHP overDHP and UP in a real-world application using Reddit data.;

We propose an extended generalized Dirichletprocess, named the similarity-based generalized Dirichlet process (SGDP), toaddress the limitations of simple random partition distributions (e.g., thoseinduced by the Dirichlet process), such as an overabundance of clusters. Thismodel prevents producing excess clusters as well as incorporates pairwisesimilarity information to ensure a more accurate and meaningful grouping. Thetheoretical properties of SGDP are studied. Then, SGDP is applied to areal-world dataset of hourly population flows in 500$\rm{m}^2$ meshes in thecentral part of Tokyo. In this empirical context, SGDP excelled at detectingmeaningful patterns in the data while accounting for spatial nuances. Theresults underscore the adaptability and utility of the method, showcasing itsprowess in revealing intricate spatiotemporal dynamics.

Arxiv;Nonparametric Variable Selection, Clustering and Prediction for  High-Dimensional Regression;Subharup Guha;Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani;2014/07/21;http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5472v3;The development of parsimonious models for reliable inference and predictionof responses in high-dimensional regression settings is often challenging dueto relatively small sample sizes and the presence of complex interactionpatterns between a large number of covariates. We propose an efficient,nonparametric framework for simultaneous variable selection, clustering andprediction in high-throughput regression settings with continuous or discreteoutcomes, called VariScan. The VariScan model utilizes the sparsity induced byPoisson-Dirichlet processes (PDPs) to group the covariates intolower-dimensional latent clusters consisting of covariates with similarpatterns among the samples. The data are permitted to direct the choice of asuitable cluster allocation scheme, choosing between PDPs and their specialcase, a Dirichlet process. Subsequently, the latent clusters are used to builda nonlinear prediction model for the responses using an adaptive mixture oflinear and nonlinear elements, thus achieving a balance between model parsimonyand flexibility. We investigate theoretical properties of the VariScanprocedure that differentiate the allocations patterns of PDPs and Dirichletprocesses both in terms of the number and relative sizes of their clusters.Additional theoretical results guarantee the high accuracy of the model-basedclustering procedure, and establish model selection and prediction consistency.Through simulation studies and analyses of benchmark data sets, we demonstratethe reliability of VariScan's clustering mechanism and show that the techniquecompares favorably to, and often outperforms, existing methodologies in termsof the prediction accuracies of the subject-specific responses.;
Arxiv;Fair Clustering via Hierarchical Fair-Dirichlet Process;Abhisek Chakraborty;Anirban Bhattacharya,Debdeep Pati;2023/05/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17557v1;The advent of ML-driven decision-making and policy formation has led to anincreasing focus on algorithmic fairness. As clustering is one of the mostcommonly used unsupervised machine learning approaches, there has naturallybeen a proliferation of literature on {\em fair clustering}. A popular notionof fairness in clustering mandates the clusters to be {\em balanced}, i.e.,each level of a protected attribute must be approximately equally representedin each cluster. Building upon the original framework, this literature hasrapidly expanded in various aspects. In this article, we offer a novelmodel-based formulation of fair clustering, complementing the existingliterature which is almost exclusively based on optimizing appropriateobjective functions.;

Arxiv;Product Centered Dirichlet Processes for Dependent Clustering;Alexander Dombowsky;David B. Dunson;2023/12/08;http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05365v1;While there is an immense literature on Bayesian methods for clustering, themultiview case has received little attention. This problem focuses on obtainingdistinct but statistically dependent clusterings in a common set of entitiesfor different data types. For example, clustering patients into subgroups withsubgroup membership varying according to the domain of the patient variables. Achallenge is how to model the across-view dependence between the partitions ofpatients into subgroups. The complexities of the partition space make standardmethods to model dependence, such as correlation, infeasible. In this article,we propose CLustering with Independence Centering (CLIC), a clustering priorthat uses a single parameter to explicitly model dependence between clusteringsacross views. CLIC is induced by the product centered Dirichlet process (PCDP),a novel hierarchical prior that bridges between independent and equivalentpartitions. We show appealing theoretic properties, provide a finiteapproximation and prove its accuracy, present a marginal Gibbs sampler forposterior computation, and derive closed form expressions for the marginal andjoint partition distributions for the CLIC model. On synthetic data and in anapplication to epidemiology, CLIC accurately characterizes view-specificpartitions while providing inference on the dependence level.;

The proposed modelpossesses properties that link the nested Dirichlet processes (nDP) and theDirichlet process mixture models (DPM) in an interesting way: integrating outall contents results in the DPM over contexts, whereas integrating outgroup-specific contexts results in the nDP mixture over content variables. Weprovide a Polya-urn view of the model and an efficient collapsed Gibbsinference procedure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstratethe advantage of utilizing context information via our model in both text andimage domains.;

However, existing methods cannot easily cluster thepassengers due to the hierarchical structure of the passenger trip information,including multiple trips within each passenger and multi-dimensionalinformation about each trip. Furthermore, existing approaches rely on anaccurate specification of the clustering number to start. Finally, existingmethods do not consider spatial semantic graphs such as geographical proximityand functional similarity between the locations. In this paper, we propose anovel tensor Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model with graphs, which canpreserve the hierarchical structure of the multi-dimensional trip informationand cluster them in a unified one-step manner with the ability to determine thenumber of clusters automatically. The spatial graphs are utilized in communitydetection to link the semantic neighbors. We further propose a tensor versionof Collapsed Gibbs Sampling method with a minimum cluster size requirement.

Ihler,Padhraic Smyth,Max Welling;2012/06/27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6845v1;Nonparametric Bayesian approaches to clustering, information retrieval,language modeling and object recognition have recently shown great promise as anew paradigm for unsupervised data analysis. Most contributions have focused onthe Dirichlet process mixture models or extensions thereof for which efficientGibbs samplers exist. In this paper we explore Gibbs samplers for infinitecomplexity mixture models in the stick breaking representation. The advantageof this representation is improved modeling flexibility. For instance, one candesign the prior distribution over cluster sizes or couple multiple infinitemixture models (e.g. over time) at the level of their parameters (i.e. thedependent Dirichlet process model). However, Gibbs samplers for infinitemixture models (as recently introduced in the statistics literature) seem tomix poorly over cluster labels. Among others issues, this can have the adverseeffect that labels for the same cluster in coupled mixture models are mixed up.We introduce additional moves in these samplers to improve mixing over clusterlabels and to bring clusters into correspondence. An application to modeling ofstorm trajectories is used to illustrate these ideas.;

After discussing some of the shortcomings of this approach, we presenta mixture model based on a generalization of the nested Dirichlet process thatclusters subjects based on the distribution of their curves. By using mixturesof generalized Dirichlet processes, the model induces a much more flexibleprior on the partition structure than other popular model-based clusteringmethods, allowing for different rates of introduction of new clusters as thenumber of observations increases. The methods are illustrated using hormoneprofiles from multiple menstrual cycles collected for women in the EarlyPregnancy Study.;

Recently, however, it has been shown that the DPMMis inconsistent in inferring the true number of components in certain cases.This is an asymptotic result, and it would be desirable to understand whetherit holds with finite samples, and to more fully understand the full posterior.In this work, we provide a rigorous study for the posterior distribution of thenumber of clusters in DPMM under different prior distributions on theparameters and constraints on the distributions of the data. We provide novellower bounds on the ratios of probabilities between $s+1$ clusters and $s$clusters when the prior distributions on parameters are chosen to be Gaussianor uniform distributions.;

In this paper, we proposed a topic detectionapproach with Parallel Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) Model by clustering avocabulary of known similar words based on TF-IDF scores and Bag of Words (BOW)technique. In the experiment, we use K-mean clustering with Elbow Method forinterpretation and validation of consistency within-cluster analysis to selectthe optimal number of clusters. We evaluate our approach by comparing it withtraditional LDA and clustering technique. The experimental results show thatcombining PLDA with Elbow method selects the optimal number of clusters andrefine the topics for the conversation.;
